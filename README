OpenSync Framework
==================

OpenSync is a plugin-based application that basically provides a framework
for syncing groups which can have two or more members. 

This is the Akonadi (KDE 4.x) PIM synchronisation framework.
It provides sync ability with KDE > 4.5 using the akonadi interface.

Important
=========

Currently Calendar does not work.


Requirements
============
- libopensync1 (v.0.40)


Installation
============
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/opensync/installation_prefix/lib/pkgconfig

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$installation_prefix /path/to/opensync/source/
make
make install

Usage
============

1. After installation configure the plugin with "--configure" option. 
   (I'm planning to make this step optional)
2. Discover supported features on both sides (sync members and akonadi) 
   with "--discover" option. This step will discover sync features (supported 
   formats) and akonadi collection. They will be available in the configuration 
   file for further setup. 
3. Reconfigure the plugin with "--configure" option. Most likely you will need 
   to enable or disable sync with given collection represented as a ressource in
   the configuration file.
4. Sync with the "--sync" or similar option
