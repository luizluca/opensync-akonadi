OpenSync Framework
==================

OpenSync is a plugin-based application that basically provides a framework
for syncing groups which can have two or more members. 

This is the Akonadi (KDE 4.x) PIM synchronisation framework.
It provides sync ability with KDE > 4.5 using the akonadi interface.

Important
=========

Currently Calendar does not work.


Requirements
============
- libopensync1 (v.0.40)


Installation
============
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/opensync/installation_prefix/lib/pkgconfig

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$installation_prefix /path/to/opensync/source/
make
make install

Usage
============

1. After installation configure the plugin with "--configure" option. 
   (This is optional if you want to have all supported sync types)
2. Discover supported features on both sides (sync members and akonadi) 
   with "--discover" option. This step will discover sync features (supported 
   formats) and akonadi collection. They will be available in the configuration 
   file for further setup (but will be disabled by default). 
3. Reconfigure the plugin with "--configure" option. Most likely you will need 
   to enable or disable sync with given collection represented as a ressource in
   the configuration file (step2 above).
4. Sync with the "--sync" or similar option

Known Issues
============

If you modify an item try to sync and reject, then things got messed up.
I'm still trying to understand why.
